# Color Match
# Overview

In this project, I created a simple color matching memory game. This game was designed for a younger audience in mind to help learn colors by matching them together as well as improving their memory.

Along with this, the purpose of this game was to make it interactive and entertaining for the user while still provide cognitive development.

I wrote this software in Kotlin to learn more about the language syntax, to learn how interact with Android Studio and take what I gained for experience to further my learning of this software.
